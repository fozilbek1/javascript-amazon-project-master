This project is a functional and responsive e-commerce website clone inspired by Amazon, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes features such as a dynamic product search bar, interactive shopping cart functionality with item addition feedback, and visually appealing product displays. The clone is designed to provide a seamless user experience and demonstrates skills in front-end development, DOM manipulation, and responsive design. Future improvements could include backend integration for user authentication, payment processing, and database connectivity for product data management.
